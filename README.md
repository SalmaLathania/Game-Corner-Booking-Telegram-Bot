## Game Corner Booking Telegram Bot

### Introduction 

This research aims to develop an automated Game Corner booking system at FILKOM UB using a Telegram Bot integrated with Decision Tree and Reinforcement Learning. This system will enable students to make bookings online more easily, quickly, and efficiently. By applying Decision Tree, the system can prioritize bookings based on the availability of consoles and the queue. Meanwhile, Reinforcement Learning will be used to improve the systemâ€™s performance by learning from each decision made, allowing it to provide more optimal decisions for the future bookings.
